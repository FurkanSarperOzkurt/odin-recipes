    <h2>Easy Lasagna Recipe</h2>
        <p>
            This recipe has simple ingredients but tons of flavor with a creamy ricotta mixture, savory meat sauce, and lots of mozzarella cheese. 
        </p>
        <p>
           This is a great freezer meal, make-ahead recipe, and leftovers freeze and reheat super well.  
        </p>
    <h2>How to Make It</h2>
        <p>
            Spoon meat sauce on the bottom of a lightly greased casserole dish. Add 4 boiled lasagna noodles (or use no-boil or fresh noodles). Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture on top. Add 1.5 cups of meat sauce.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Repeat the same layers two more times.
        </p>
        <p>
            Top with mozzarella cheese. Cover and bake at 375° for 30 minutes. Remove cover and bake for 15 more minutes. Broil at the end if desired. Let it rest for 15 minutes prior to serving with Garlic Bread With Cheese.
        </p>
    <h2>How Many Layers Does Lasagna Have</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Lasagna needs to have at least 3 layers in order to constitute a true lasagna. Most recipes have 3 or 4 layer
            </li>
            <li>
                I opted for 3 layers of 4 lasagna noodles as that is what will fit in a 9 x 13 inch casserole dish. Additional layers would require a deeper baking dish. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Make Ahead Method</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Assemble as outlined but do not bake. Cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze for up to 3 months.
            </li>
            <li>
                Thaw frozen lasagna completely before baking.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let chilled lasagna sit out at room temperature for 30 minutes prior to baking. Add an additional 10 minutes to covered baking time.
            </li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Reheating Lasagna</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                To reheat leftover lasagna: Place it in a lightly greased, covered casserole dish. Bake at 350° for 25-30 minutes.
            </li>
        </ul>

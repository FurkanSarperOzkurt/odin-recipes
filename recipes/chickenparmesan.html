    <h2>Chicken Parmesan</h2>
        <p>
            You’ve just found the crispiest, most restaurant-worthy Chicken Parmesan recipe out there! In this recipe, I use some chef-inspired techniques combined with years of my own chicken parmesan-making experience to create the best dish that you and your family will love!
        </p>
        <p>
            Each layer in this breading has the best flavors and textures. And baking the chicken parmesan on a baking sheet (instead of in a dish with marinara sauce), ensures that you have super crispy chicken that will stay crispy until the very last bite.

    <h2>How to Make It</h2>
        <p>
            Slice the chicken to create 2-3 thinner slices. Use a meat tenderizer to pound to 1/2-inch thick. Pat dry and season with salt and pepper. Dredge in flour, egg, and breadcrumb mixtures and fry in oil until crispy. Set aside on a wire cooling rack.

            Transfer chicken to a baking sheet and top with marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese. Bake for 15 minutes. Garnish with parsley and serve!

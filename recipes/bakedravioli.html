        <p>
            My favorite part about this recipe, (aside from how delicious it is), is the fact that you don’t have to boil the ravioli prior to assembling. 🤯 There is an abundance of sauce in this recipe that the ravioli cooks in while it’s in the oven. Not only does it make the ravioli super flavorful, but you can rest assure that the ravioli will be perfectly cooked without splitting and falling apart.

           💥BONUS #1: Refrigerated or frozen ravioli works beautifully for this.

            Now about this meat sauce. It has a hint of creaminess to it which is a nice way to offset the acidity from the marinara, and the meat itself is flavored with the best combination of seasonings and subtle flavor enhancers, all of which makes this an above-average dish.

            💥BONUS #2: You can also make it ahead of time and bake it up to 2 days later or freeze it for up to 3 months.
